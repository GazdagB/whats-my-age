# Age Calculator

A simple, yet powerful JavaScript library for calculating age and time intervals from a given date. Whether you need to calculate the age in years, months, days, or weeks, or you require a detailed breakdown of the age in all these units, this library has got you covered. It accepts both string and Date object inputs for birthdates.

We've designed this library with ease of use in mind, making it a breeze to integrate into your projects. Whether you're building a birthday reminder app, an age verification system, or just curious about how old something (or someone) is, our Age Calculator is here to help. Plus, we've made sure to handle the tricky bits, like leap years, so you don't have to worry about the details.

## Features

- Calculate age in years, months, days, or weeks.
- Get a detailed breakdown of age in years, months, weeks, and days.
- Supports both `Date` objects and date strings in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format as input.
- Comprehensive validation of input date strings.
- Leap years? No problem! Our calculations automatically account for them.

## Installation

Ready to get started? Install via npm with a simple command:

Install via npm:

```
npm install how-old
```

## Leap Years? Absolutely!

Worried about leap years messing up your calculations? Fear not! The approach used in the library incorporates leap years automatically. This is because the calculation relies on the JavaScript Date object and the subtraction of two dates. So, whether it's a leap year or not, you'll get accurate results every time.
